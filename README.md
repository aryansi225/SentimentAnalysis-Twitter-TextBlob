# SentimentAnalysis-Twitter-TextBlob
The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. We then put the tweet text and the sentiment value (Positive/Negative) based on some threshold value([0,1] --> positive and [-1,0) --> negative).
